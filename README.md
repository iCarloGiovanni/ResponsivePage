This is a sample single-page I worked in for a job's skills interview. It is built with pure **HTML**, **CSS** and a little of **JavaScript** to handle some styling behavior.
It is built from a given custom design in .PSD format, in Adobe Photohsop.
It is a **responsive** web page with a home page and two additional sections (full responsiveness for medium-screen devices still pending).

To open and view, open _index.html_ file on a web browser or follow the link! https://icarlogiovanni.github.io/ResponsivePage/

Tip: Reload the page when changing between screen sizes for better results.
